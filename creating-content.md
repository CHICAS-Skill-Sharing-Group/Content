# Making a new contribution

## Steps
1. Add the topic to the [main page](https://github.com/CHICAS-Skill-Sharing-Group/Content/blob/master/README.md) if it's not already there (edit README.md file then 'commit' and 'push').
2. Navigate into the subfolder that this new topic should sit within (or if a new subfolder needs to be made, please create it in the appropriate existing folder).
3. Create the new file (name needs '.md' at the end)
4. Return to the [main page](https://github.com/CHICAS-Skill-Sharing-Group/Content/blob/master/README.md) and now add a hyperlink to your topic title by writing '[your topic title](url of its file)'
