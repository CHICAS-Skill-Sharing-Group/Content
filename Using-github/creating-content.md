# How to contribute content to this project

## Steps for adding a new topic
1. Add the topic to the [main page](https://github.com/CHICAS-Skill-Sharing-Group/Content/blob/master/README.md) if it's not already there (edit README.md file then 'commit' and 'push').
2. Navigate into the subfolder that this new topic should sit within (or if a new subfolder needs to be made, please create it in the appropriate existing folder).
3. Create the new file (name needs '.md' at the end)
4. Return to the [main page](https://github.com/CHICAS-Skill-Sharing-Group/Content/blob/master/README.md) and all folders within which the new file lies and now add a hyperlink to your topic title by writing [your topic title](url of its file)

## Referencing external material
When pre-existing resources meet the criteria for inclusion, a new topic page should still be created and a link should be inserted on this page to guide the reader to the resource(s). If multiple resources are available, it would be useful for an introductory sentence or paragraph to be written to clearly explain their value to the reader.
